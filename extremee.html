    <h2>Overview:</h2>

    <p>
      This is McLaren's first year in Extreme E, as this newer sport has been
      growing in popularity. This was an excellent opportunity for McLaren to
      expand its racing potential into the world of all-electric SUV off-road
      racing, while also joining the movement of being more sustainable.

    <p id="caption">
      The MX is McLaren's answer to making an all electric off-road vehicle. In
      it's first season, this car will promote not only McLaren racing's brand
      name, but also help in a shift towards more sustainable racing.
